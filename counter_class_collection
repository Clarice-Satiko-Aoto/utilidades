##Use Counter to find the most common occurences of a value in a list

import collections
counter = collections.Counter([1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5])
counter
#print in dictionary


counter.most_common()

#A counter is a sub-class of the dictionary. 
#It is used to keep the count of the elements in an iterable in the form of an unordered dictionary 
#where the key represents the element in the iterable and value represents the count of that element in the iterable.
